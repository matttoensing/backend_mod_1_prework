## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* The article made me think about the process of learning. Especially how Super Learners adopt a mindset that focuses on your desired learning goals. Also, taking care of your brain is just as important as taking care of your body. It's an organ and it needs exercise!
* Items from the list I already do are reading frequently and teaching other what I know/have learned.
* I'd like to "take care" of my brain more and also start incorporating short breaks. I think I take care of brain but I could be doing a better job. I am horrible at taking breaks. On previous jobs sometimes I would hardly stop for lunch. This comes from working an entire summer in the mountains not taking breaks ever! I would like to start doing more of everything on the list. Something I have started doing is adopting the growth mindset.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
* Using a .rb file, use the code puts "Hello World!". Then, in the terminal, I would run the command ruby <file name.rb>

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
* `#`
4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
* An integer is a whole number such as 1, 5, 5938, 999, 0. A float is a number with a decimal point such as 1.93, 659.2928, 0.92828, 2.4

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
* `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
* `puts animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
* Interpolation is adding a variable (or the value of a given variable) into a string.
```
animal = "zebra"
puts "One of my favorite mammals that roams the African Savanah is the #{animal}"
```
8. What method is used to get input from a user?
* `gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
* `.length` - This method determines the total length of your string
* `.gsub` - Means global substitution. This method replaces a character every time it occurs with another character
