## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* What resonated for me was when they talked about making lists for things you are struggling with in the video. Creating a list for your struggles or what you need to improve on can force you to reflect on how you are learning, or what you need to work on. They also mentioned adding steps for improvement in the list. This is great advice. I would probably start by creating the list itself, think about it, and then go back and add steps on what I think I could do to improve in each subject.
* Something that was new to me was to set `S.M.A.R.T.` goals on your learning path. This seems like a great concept and I need to learn more about SMART goals to incorporate them into my learning.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I know that I am capable of learning, especially if I want to learn something. I find it easier to learn when you are not being forced to learn something and want to learn on your own. Some subjects I had in college I felt like I was forced to take and I didn't get as much out of the class because I didn't want to be in that class.
* One way I am not demonstrating a growth mindset is that I sometimes avoid challenges. This comes out of fear of the outcome or from fear of how others will perceive my results of the challenge. For example, when I was doing tree work with the first company I worked for, I often didn't do the big, technical jobs even though I was capable of doing them. I would be afraid of doing something my Boss wouldn't approve of, or smashing something.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* A hash is a collection storage device, similar to a database. The elements in the hash are referred to by a name or the key. It is comprised of "keys" and "values" usually inside of (or stored in) a variable. They are different from arrays as arrays use integers for the index and hashes can use any object type. Also, hashes are unordered.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {
  "Dog food" => 22,
  "Cat food" => 17,
  "Fish tanks" => 9,
  "Bird cages" => 5
}
```
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
p states["IA"]
```
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
p states.keys
p states.values
```
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* Another example of when we might use a hash is when we need to specify the exact value of the key. An example of this would be listing people's phone numbers and being able to look them up. The key would be names of people and the values would be their phone numbers. This is better than an array because the array would list the people and those people would be assigned an integer as part of the index and not by their phone numbers.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
