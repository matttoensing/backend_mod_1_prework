Have the time estimates matched up with your experience?
- For the pre-work, it has been more or less spot on. It has been leaning towards the longer end of the time estimates though. I tend to work on things thoroughly, starting from the beginning. I don't like to get side tracked, because it is easy to miss something, or hard to figure out what you need to go back to. This can make my work a bit slower which is fine for me, its just my methodology.  

When you sit down to start working, do you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish and in how much time? If so, how aligned is that to what actually happens?
- I have a clear goal of what I want to accomplish, but I don't give strict time constraints for it. As in, when I am done is when I am done. It's too new right now to closely monitor my time strictly. I know as I progress, I will watch my time more closely. But setting goals when I sit down to work is pretty easy, such as I am going to finish this homework assignment, or I am going to review my notes with the slides from the previous sessions. It aligns pretty well with what actually happens. I don't think I get distracted much or move onto other tasks when I sit down to work.

How do you work best - in 2 hour blocks, 4 hour blocks, etc? Do you take breaks regularly? Do you have a system to hold yourself accountable to taking breaks?
- It all depends on the day and what needs to get done. I can work in 4 hour chunks just fine, and time moves by quickly! I do take breaks, but they are short. Usually to get tea or go on a walk. And I know when I am done for the day because I start to get sloppy, or a cloudy head.  Breaks are something that is hard for me. I have worked on jobs where we didn't really get breaks. Sitting on my computer for long periods of time is not too bad compared to that.


Pomodoro Technique
- Pomodoro means 'tomato' in Italian
-  fundamental steps:
  1. Decide on the task to be performed
  2. Set the Pomodoro timer (or any timer)
  3. Work away at specified task
  4. When timer goes off, stop working and record checkmark on a piece of paper
  5. If you have less than four checkmarks, take a quick 2-3 minute break and then return to step 2. If you have more than 4 checkmarks, then move onto step 6.
  6. After 4 checkmarks or Pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break, clear the checkmarks, and then reset to step 1 and start the cycle over
